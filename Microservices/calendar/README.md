# 📅 Team Calendar

A full-stack calendar application for teams to manage and share events.

## 📖 Overview

This application powers the Team Calendar, providing a user-friendly interface for teams to create, manage, and view shared events. The system consists of a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB database.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `client/` - React frontend application
  - **src/** – Source code of the React app:
    * **components/** – React components:
      * `Calendar.jsx` – Main calendar UI component
      * `Login.jsx` – Login form/page component
      * `Modal.jsx` – Popup/modal UI component
    * **services/** – Logic for external services or API calls:
      * `eventService.js` – Handles event-related API calls
    * `App.js` – Root React component
    * `App.css`, `index.css`, `styles.css` – Styling files
    * `index.js` – React app entry point
- `server/` - Node.js/Express backend API

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express, MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Frontend:** React
- **Remote Access:** ngrok

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Server Setup (Backend)

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```
   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the server directory and add your MongoDB connection string:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

5. The server will run on port 5000 by default (http://localhost:5000)

### Client Setup (Frontend)

1. Open a new terminal window/tab

2. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```
   cd client
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the React development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. The frontend application will run on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000)

### Remote Access with ngrok

To make your backend accessible from anywhere:

1. Open another terminal window/tab

2. Run ngrok to expose your local server:
   ```
   ngrok http 5000
   ```

3. ngrok will provide a public URL (like `https://abc123def456.ngrok.io`)

4. You can now access your backend API from anywhere using this URL
   - Example: `https://abc123def456.ngrok.io/api/events`

## ⚙️ Step-by-step: How to Use Ngrok

### 🔧 1. Install ngrok

If you're on Windows/Mac/Linux, just:
- Download from: https://ngrok.com/download
- Unzip → Move it to your system path or keep in project folder

Or, using terminal (if installed via package manager):
```bash
brew install ngrok     # macOS
choco install ngrok    # Windows
```

### 🔑 2. Connect Your Account

After signup at ngrok.com, you'll get an Auth token.
Run this once:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

### 🚀 3. Expose Your Local App

If your backend runs on port 5000:
```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

You'll see something like:
```
Forwarding  https://randomstring.ngrok.io  ->  http://localhost:5000
```

Use that public URL (https://randomstring.ngrok.io) anywhere — e.g., for webhook testing or sharing with others.

  .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching events:', error));
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Make sure MongoDB is up and running before starting the server
- The backend API endpoints are accessible at http://localhost:5000/api/events
- The frontend application will automatically connect to the backend
- The ngrok URL is temporary and will change each time you restart ngrok (unless you have a paid account)

## 🔍 Verifying Installation

1. After starting both the client and server, open your browser to http://localhost:3000
2. You should see the Team Calendar interface
3. Test API access by visiting http://localhost:5000/api in your browser

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- If you encounter connection issues, verify MongoDB is running
- Check the server logs for any errors related to database connection
- If the client can't connect to the server, verify both are running and check for CORS issues
- If ngrok shows errors, ensure your server is running properly on port 5000
